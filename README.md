Hey and welcome!

In order for the code to work there are some steps that needs to be taken.

#1. First off, we need to install Node.js.
Please head over to https://nodejs.org/en/ and follow the steps to install it.
We will need it to create our project.

#2. Dependancies
** Body-Parser **
First we install bodyParser, you can do so by typing 'npm i body-parser'
in the terminal. The Body-parser module parses JSON buffer, string and URL encoded
data submitted.

** express **
In order to install express, type 'npm i express' in the terminal.
We need the express framework since it provides a robust set of features for our web application.

** sqlite3 **
In order to install sqlite3, type 'npm i sqlite3' in the terminal.
SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database.
With this it allows accessing the database using a nonstandard varient of
the SQL query language.

To save time you can also install all of these at once typing 'npm i body-parser express sqlite3'.
